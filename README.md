This repository contains the implementation of deep learning and hybrid ensemble models with SHAP-based explainability used in the research paper:

‚ÄúAnalysing agricultural distress in the eastern plateau of West Bengal's Rarh Region: integrating hybrid deep ensemble and GIS-based soft computing‚Äù
Published in Discover Applied Sciences, Springer Nature, Open Access, Volume 7, Article 664 (2025), on 18 June 2025.

üîç Purpose

The models were developed to predict agricultural distress zones in the Rarh Region of West Bengal, India, by integrating:

Hybrid Deep Ensemble Learning (CNN, LSTM, DFFNN)

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for interpretability

GIS-based soft computing techniques for spatial analysis

‚öôÔ∏è Features

Preprocessing of agricultural and socio-economic data

Training deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, DFFNN)

Evaluation of predictive performance (accuracy, loss)

SHAP-based feature importance and visualization (bar plots, beeswarm plots)

Integration with GIS-based outputs for mapping agricultural distress

This code demonstrates how explainable AI can be combined with spatial analysis to study The Spatial extension of Rural Agricultural vulnerability.
